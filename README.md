# Yoga Pose Identification:

This mini-project demonstrates how to train a custom-built and transfer learning model for image classification using the Yoga 107 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arrowe/yoga-poses-dataset-107), as well as how to deploy the models within a simple web application.
The notebook "pose_estimation_demo.ipynb" contains screenshots demonstrating the application in use, and "yopa.py" contains code for the application itself. The notebooks "yoga_pose_custom_cnn.ipynb" and "yoga_pose_transfer_learning.ipynb" contain code to generate the models used within the application.

Finally, I explored an alternative model architecture using Ultralytics' YOLO tool as a means of extracting feature information from the images, in conjunction with a simple feed-forward neural network. This is contained within the "yoga_pose_YOLO.ipynb" notebook.
